This program will turn a video into a video of collages. To get it working you need to do the following:


Put the small images you want to use in the to make up the collages, in computation/images

put the video that you want to convert into the main directory, and run cut_up_video.py. This will chop the video file into lots of frames and put it in input.

Run movie maker to make the frames

run combine video to turn the frames into a video file




You can edit setup to change the resolution and number of patches in the final product.
